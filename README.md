This repository hosts a face detection-based attendance system. It includes the main file containing all the necessary code. When executed, this code launches an interface that displays your face in real-time. The system uses facial recognition technology to identify you and marks your attendance by matching your face with the data stored in a Firebase database. If your face matches an entry in the database, you will be marked as present automatically.
